												---- RC CAR 2023 ----

This is the Raspberry Pi currently being used for controlling the RC car and later, the balancing robot.
If needed, the username is "pi" and the password is "raspberry2".

												---- OPERATION ----
												
On startup, the scripts needed to run the RC car should automatically open up. 
If for some reason you dont want the scripts operating on startup, modify the "/etc/rc.local"
file, or I guess you could just delete the script. 

The RC car can be controlled via PS3 controller (specifically the Mad Giga one in the lab, but others should work fine)
Use up/down on the left joustick to accelerate left and right, and use left/right on the right joystick to turn.
If for whatever reason you need to kill the program, the select button kills the motors. (I'll make sure it safely turns the pi off later as well)
Controls can be modified by editing the "miniCar.lyt" file in QJoyPad.
